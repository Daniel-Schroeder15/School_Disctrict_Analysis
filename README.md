# School_Disctrict_Analysis

## Challenge Overview
A City School System employee has given me the following tasks to gather insights on various schools'.

1. Create a duplicate of PyCitySchools.ipynb and rename it PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb.
2. Correct the students' names so there are no professional prefixes or suffixes.
3. Replace the reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaN.(After dataset)
4. Clean student dataset and format correctly
5. Create a summary of the insights on performance trends and patterns with the datasets. 
6. Recreate the district and school summary DataFrames.

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv; students_complete.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook (anaconda python 3.7)

The PyCitySchools.ipynb has the complete data with the original reading and math 9th grade scores from Thomas High School (Before dataset)
The PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb has the data replaced with NaN (After dataset)

## Challenge summary
After replacing the reading and math scores for the Thomas High School 9th graders, I recreated the district and school summary DataFrames. 

After replacing the data with Not A Number(NaN):
- district Average Math Score decreased from 79.0 to 78.9.
- district Average Reading Score was unchanged.
- Percent passing math decreased from 75% to 74%
- Percent passing reading decreased from 86% to 85%
- Percent overall Passing decreased from 65% to 64%
- School summary shows that the percent passing math and reading dramatically went down roughly 28 to 25 percent respectively.
- The change in percentage caused the school to drop from the 2nd top school to the 8th ranked top school.
- Math and reading scores for all other schools and all of the other grades remained the same. 
- The average scores by school spending, size, and type remained the same
- The percent passing math, reading, and overall by school spending, size, and type decreased by roughly 6%, 6%, 4% respectively.


In analyzing the city school systems', we have aggregated the data so we can perform insights on performance trends and patterns. Examined and prepared all the standardized test data, budget, spending ranges and school size for reporting.
